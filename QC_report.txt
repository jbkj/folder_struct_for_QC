QC started _ by _

We start with _ individuals and _ SNPs.

We used a 0.05 cut-off for individuals and SNPs missingness, removing _ individuals and _ SNPs, leaving:
_ SNPs
_ indivuals

For the inbreeding QC we use the following cut-offs:
Rare alleles: 
Common alleles:
This remove _ individuals leaving:
_ individuals

For the PCA QC we use the following cut-offs:
PCA1: 
PCA2: 
Removing _ individuals leaving:
_ individuals
Thus after coarse QC we have removed at total of _ individuals and _ SNPs, leaving for zcall:
_ individuals and
_ SNPs
------------------------------
zcall QC:
We use Threshold_ with the following concordance:


From the pedigree QC we remove _ doublicates and _ individuals with missing or wrong particid (other projects on chip), leaving:
_ individuals


Before LDpruning we use a HWE threshold on 0.005 which removes _ SNPs leaving:
_ SNPs.

In IBD QC we remove _ individuals leaving:
_ individuals

From Gender QC we remove _ individuals with missing or wrong gender-code, leaving:
_ indiviuals

In Barcoding QC we remove _ mismatched samples and saves _ swapped sampled, leaving:
_ individuals

Thus, the final number of individuals and SNPs removed by QC is:
BEFORE QC:
_ individuals
_ SNPs
Leaving the final number of individuals and SNPs to be:
AFTER QC:
_ individuals
_ SNPs
