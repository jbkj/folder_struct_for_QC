QC started _ by _

Cohort name: _ (Project ID=)

Chip used: _

We start with _ (_ in final report) individuals and _ SNPs. 

We used a 0.05 cut-off for individuals and SNPs missingness, removing _ individuals and _ SNPs, leaving:
_ SNPs
_ indivuals

For the inbreeding QC we use the following cut-offs:
Rare alleles: _ to _
Common alleles: _ to _
This remove _ individuals leaving:
_ individuals

For the MDS QC we use the following cut-offs:
MDS1: _ to _
MDS2: _ to _
Removing _ individuals leaving:
_ individuals


From the pedigree QC we remove - duplicates and 0 individuals with missing or wrong particid (other projects on chip), leaving:
_ individuals

In IBD QC we remove _ individuals (lowest callrate in pairs of undocumented IBD (MZ twins, parent offspring, siblings or half-siblings)) leaving:
_ individuals

From Sex QC we note there 4 known samples without sex that we do not sort out (from DZ twins). We remove _ individuals with missing (SNP = 0) or wrong gender-code (PED!=SNP), and updating (when PED=0) _ individuals sex-code, leaving:
_ indiviuals

We update the SNPs to build 37 using build_script from http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/strand/
This leaves us:
_ SNPs

We have to redo the geno call-rate of 95% again (--geno 0.05) for both the TOP strand and the PLUS strand version.
For the PLUS_b37 strand version we _ remove SNPs, leaving the final number:
_ indiviuals 
_ SNPs
For the TOP strand version we remove _ SNPs, leaving the final number:
_ indiviuals 
_ SNPs

All removed individuals are recorded (as barcodes) in removed_individuals in the root folder with this document.

The two final plinkQC versions (TOP and PLUS_b37) is put in /eva/data/clean/_/chip/
as well as linked in the final folder from this directory

Thus, the final number of individuals and SNPs removed by QC is:
BEFORE QC:
_ (_ in final report) individuals
_ SNPs

REMOVED in QC:
_ (_ belonged to another study) individuals
TOP:
_ SNPs
PLUS:
_ SNPs

Leaving the final number of individuals and SNPs to be:
AFTER QC:
_ individuals
TOP:
_ SNPs
PLUS:
_ SNPs
