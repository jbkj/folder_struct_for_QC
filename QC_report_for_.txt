QC started _ by _

Cohort name:

Chip used:

We start with _ individuals and _ SNPs.

We used a 0.05 cut-off for individuals and SNPs missingness, removing _ individuals and _ SNPs, leaving:
_ SNPs
_ indivuals

For the inbreeding QC we use the following cut-offs:
Rare alleles: 
Common alleles:
This remove _ individuals leaving:
_ individuals

For the PCA QC we use the following cut-offs:
PCA1: 
PCA2: 
Removing _ individuals leaving:
_ individuals
Thus after coarse QC we have removed at total of _ individuals and _ SNPs, leaving for zcall:
_ individuals and
_ SNPs


From the pedigree QC we remove _ doublicates and _ individuals with missing or wrong particid (other projects on chip), leaving:
_ individuals

Before LDpruning we use a HWE threshold on 0.005 which removes _ SNPs leaving:
_ SNPs.

In IBD QC we remove _ individuals leaving:
_ individuals

From Gender QC we remove _ individuals with missing or wrong gender-code, leaving:
_ indiviuals

We update the SNPs to build 37 using build_script from http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/strand/
This leaves us:
_ SNPs

We have to redo the geno call-rate of 95% again (--geno 0.05) for both the TOP strand and the PLUS strand version.
For the PLUS_b37 strand version we _ remove SNPs, leaving the final number:
_ indiviuals 
_ SNPs
For the TOP strand version we remove _ SNPs, leaving the final number:
_ indiviuals 
_ SNPs

All removed individuals are recorded in removed_individuals in the root folder with this document.
Both particid and barcode is recorded when possible.

The two final plinkQC versions (TOP and PLUS_b37) is put in /eva/data/clean/_/chip/
as well as linked in the final folder from this directory


Thus, the final number of individuals and SNPs removed by QC is:
BEFORE QC:
_ individuals
_ SNPs

Removed in QC:
_ individuals
_ SNPs

Leaving the final number of individuals and SNPs to be:
AFTER QC:
_ individuals
_ SNPs
